    <p>Game or quarry is any animal hunted for its meat or sport. The term game arises in medieval hunting terminology by the late 13th century and is particular to English, the word derived from the generic Old English gamen (Germanic *gamanan) "joy, amusement,
        sport, merriment". Quarry in the generic meaning is early modern (first recorded 1610), in the more specific sense "bird targeted in falconry" late 14th and 15th centuries as quirre "entrails of deer placed on the hide and given to the hunting-dogs
        as a reward", from Old French cuiriee "spoil, quarry" (ultimately Latin corium "hide"), but influenced by cor√©e "viscera, entrails" (Late Latin *corata "entrails", from cor "heart"). Wild game meat (usually considered to include animals harvested
        from game reserves) is generally considered to be superior in nutrient density and usually has lower fat content than meat procured through contemporary farming methods, while the cost in time and money to procure wild game is much higher. Small
        game includes small animals, such as rabbits, pheasants, geese or ducks. Large game includes animals like deer, moose, and bear. Big game is a term sometimes used interchangeably with large game although in other contexts it refers to large, typically
        African, mammals (specifically "big five game" or "dangerous game") which are hunted mainly for trophies.</p>
